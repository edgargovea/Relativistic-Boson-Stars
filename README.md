# Relativistic Boson Star Numerical Solutions

This repository contains a project dedicated to characterizing numerical solutions for relativistic boson stars, both interacting and non-interacting cases (Massive Boson Stars and Mini-Boson Stars).

## Overview

Compact objects like white dwarfs and neutron stars are part of the entities that populate the universe and play a role in astrophysical and cosmological observations. These objects belong to the family of compact fermionic objects that conform to the universe.

Parallel to these objects are **boson stars**, hypothetical compact objects made of spin \(s = 0\) bosons, and **Proca stars**, compact objects made of spin \(s = 1\) bosons. These hypothetical objects could account for dark matter: massive self-gravitating scalar (or vector) fields can form stable astrophysical (or subatomic) objects supported by self-gravity and Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.

Although the cold dark matter model (CDM) within the standard cosmological model \(\Lambda\)CDM explains large-scale structure so well, it faces issues on galactic scales:  
- CDM simulations predict cuspy density profiles at galactic centers, whereas rotation curves suggest smooth cores.  
- The predicted number of satellite galaxies around galactic halos is higher than observed.  

If dark matter is composed of boson particles in a Bose-Einstein condensate (as in boson stars), these problems might be mitigated. Boson and Proca star phenomenology could address the cusp and missing satellite problems.

## Scientific Context

A **compact object** is a collective arrangement of quantum particles forming a stable macroscopic entity. John Wheeler (1955) proposed stable solutions to the electromagnetic field under general relativity called **geons**, which are unstable. Conversely, **boson** and **Proca stars** are stable solutions to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon and Einstein-Proca systems, respectively.

These objects form a macroscopic condensate of integer spin particles characterized by a single wave function \(\Psi(t, \vec{x})\). Boson stars may have masses comparable to neutron stars or even larger, making them compelling subjects of study and candidates for dark matter.

## Relativistic and Non-Relativistic Boson Stars

We study:

1. **Einstein-Klein-Gordon system** (relativistic boson stars)  

These systems can include a self-interaction term, parameterized by a dimensionless coupling constant \(\lambda\). When \(\lambda\) is negligible, the systems reduce to:

- **Mini-boson stars** (relativistic)  
- **Schrödinger-Poisson system** (non-relativistic)

If the mass is small, relativistic effects can be neglected, and the Newtonian approximation is valid. For masses approaching the Kaup limit (\(M_{\text{Kaup}} = 0.633 M_{\text{Pl}}^2 / m\)), relativistic effects are crucial. Beyond this mass, no equilibrium configurations exist, similar to fermionic stars.  

Self-interacting boson stars have a maximum mass \(M_{\text{max}} = 0.06 \lambda M_{\text{Pl}}^3 / m^2\), comparable to fermion stars, making them particularly interesting.

## Astrophysical Relevance

Due to their mass, size, and stability, boson stars could be viable dark matter candidates. Observations via gravitational waves and lensing could shed light on their existence. Non-relativistic boson stars can be modeled as **Bose-Einstein condensates** with wave function \(\psi(t, \vec{x})\), governed by:

- **Gross-Pitaevskii equation** (wave function evolution)  
- **Poisson equation** (Newtonian gravitational potential)

Equilibrium arises from the balance of self-interaction pressure, self-gravity, and quantum pressure.
